Follow AGENTS.md + /ops directives: update /ops specs before touching /src; IA limited to sections begin-with, data-utilities, ai-capabilities, basic-workflows, faq with shared slug IDs per locale; nav/menu content comes from `_data/nav.<lang>.yml` and must align with actual files. Maintain 3-column layout (sidebar/content/TOC+assistant rail), vanilla CSS using tokens from `/ops/style-design.md`, and ESM-only JS under `src/assets/js`. Tags are defined centrally, max five per page, and workflows inherit tags from their host AI-capability slug. Any IA, layout, token, or major UX change requires an ADR in `ops/adr`. Slug changes, nav reorderings, or tag additions cannot happen automatically; unresolved ambiguity must be raised before coding.
