Before finishing any change: ensure `/ops` reflects the intended rule and matches `/src` changes, confirm slugs/tags/nav entries stay consistent (<=5 tags, shared JA/EN slug IDs), keep IA order intact, and verify no unauthorized layout/token tweaks. Run `npm run build` (if relevant) and `npm run test:playwright` when behavior changes. Provide ADR updates for IA/nav/layout decisions and document diffs for review with screenshots of UI adjustments.
