Comfy-with-ComfyUI is an Eleventy-powered (ESM-only) documentation site that teaches users how to set up and operate ComfyUI across JA/EN locales. `/ops` defines the canonical IA, tokens, and rules; `/src` implements them via vanilla CSS, Nunjucks templates, and JS modules. Content lives under `src/content/<lang>/<section>/<slug>/`, workflow JSON definitions are stored in `src/workflows/<slug>/*.json`, global data in `src/_data`, and assets in `src/assets` (css, js, fonts, icons, mock imagery). Build artifacts emit into `_site`.
