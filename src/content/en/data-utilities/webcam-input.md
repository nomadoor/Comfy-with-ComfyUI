## Capturing PC Screen Using OBS

Using the **Virtual Camera** function of **[OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/download)**, which is famous as streaming software, you can send the desktop screen or a specific window to ComfyUI as webcam footage.

It's more of an OBS feature than ComfyUI, but I'll introduce it because it's convenient.

### 1. OBS Settings

Install OBS and set up the screen you want to capture.

- **Source Settings (Window Capture)**
  - Select `Window Capture` from `+` in Sources and specify a specific software (e.g., Paint).
  - ![](https://i.gyazo.com/3ae7154d9a7d58b54a5e331858a119ad.png){gyazo=loop}
  - **Capture Method**: If the screen is black, changing it to `Windows 10 (1903 or later)` may make it appear (often happens with drawing software like Affinity).
  - **Cursor**: Uncheck "Capture Cursor" if you prefer.

- **Canvas Size**
  - Although not mandatory, matching the resolution generated by ComfyUI from `Settings` → `Video` makes aspect ratio management easier.

### 2. Start Virtual Camera

Click **Start Virtual Camera** in the `Controls` at the bottom right of OBS.
Now the OBS screen will be recognized as a webcam.


### 3. Loading in ComfyUI

Return to ComfyUI and change the settings of the `Webcam Capture` node.

- 1. Select **`OBS Virtual Camera`** from the camera selection dropdown
    - *If it does not appear, please reload ComfyUI (`F5`).
- 2. When executed, the OBS screen is captured as an image.

### Real-time Execution (Auto Queue)

Normal execution is fine if you just want to take one still image, but if you want to AI-convert your drawing in real-time, use **`Run (Instant)`** in the `▷ Run` menu.
