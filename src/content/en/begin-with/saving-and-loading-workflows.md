### Embed in Generated Image and Save

Images generated by ComfyUI's standard image saving nodes (such as `Save Image`) automatically have workflow metadata (setting information) embedded. Just by loading this image, you can reproduce the workflow at the time of generation.


### Save as Screenshot

If you install custom nodes such as **[ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts](https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts)**, you can take a screenshot of the entire workflow and save it with metadata embedded.
