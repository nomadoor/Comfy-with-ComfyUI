## Introduction

Welcome to **ComfyUI for Comfy usage**.

There are many excellent explanations of ComfyUI, including the official documentation.
However, I felt that there was surprisingly little information about the points where beginners tend to stumble at first, so I am explaining mainly those parts.

For veteran users, I think it will be a good place to know how ComfyUI is evolving.

> Some pages are already completed, but many pages are still **WIP**. Please look forward to completion!

## Sections

By switching the **Section Tab** on the top left, articles corresponding to each theme will be displayed.
The outline of the main sections is as follows.

### 🧭 Begin With ComfyUI
Introduces the introduction and basic operation of ComfyUI.
For those who want to proceed with the shortest distance from setup to the first generation.

### 🖼️ Data / Image Utilities
Summarizes how to prepare images and data used for generation.
Covers image processing/conversion, and how to handle many images at once.

### 🔼 AI Capabilities
Many beginners do not know **what kind of AI exists in the first place** before using AI.
It is structured so that you can reverse lookup "what kind of AI can be used" from "what you want to do".

The very simple mechanism of generative AI is also explained here.

### 🗺️ Basic Workflows
Explanation of basic Workflows.
It is not much different from the ComfyUI template, but it has a more minimal and easy-to-understand structure.

### ☹️ FAQ / Troubleshooting
Organizes common questions such as "Why are there many 512px?" and "Why is LoRA compatibility different?".
Also collects errors and troubles likely to be encountered in ComfyUI, and introduces their causes and countermeasures.

## Workflow Copy Button

This site provides JSON for almost all workflows introduced.

Although not well known, if you copy the JSON text of the workflow and press **Ctrl + V** on the ComfyUI canvas, you can paste the workflow as it is.
