## Introduction

Welcome to **Comfy-with-ComfyUI**!

There are many excellent explanations of ComfyUI, including the official documentation.
However, I felt that there was surprisingly little information on points where beginners tend to stumble at first, so I am focusing on explaining those parts.

I think it will be a good place for veteran users to know how ComfyUI is evolving.

> Some pages are already complete, but many are still **WIP**. Look forward to completion!

## Sections

By switching the **Section Tab** on the top left, articles corresponding to each theme will be displayed.
The outline of the main sections is as follows.

### 🧭 Begin With ComfyUI
Introduces the installation and basic operation of ComfyUI.

### 🖼️ Data / Image Utilities
Summarizes how to prepare images and data used for generation.
It covers image processing/conversion and how to handle many images at once.

### 🔼 AI Capabilities
Many beginners do not know **what kinds of AI exist in the first place** before how to use AI.
It is structured so that you can look up "what AI can be used" from "what you want to do".

The very simple mechanism of image generation AI is also explained here.

### 🗺️ Basic Workflows
Explanation of basic workflows.
It is not much different from ComfyUI's template, but it has a more minimal and easy-to-understand structure.

### ☹️ FAQ / Troubleshooting
Summarizes questions that are now taken for granted, such as "Why are there many 512px?" and "Seed value 1234 and 1235 are completely different things".

Also, errors and troubles likely to be encountered in ComfyUI are collected, and their causes and countermeasures are introduced.

## Workflow Copy Button

This site provides JSON for almost all workflows introduced.

Although not well known, if you copy the JSON text of the workflow and
press **Ctrl + V** on the ComfyUI canvas, you can paste the workflow as is.

Please make use of it!

## How to Face Generative AI

Generative AI expands possibilities that did not exist before, but it **cannot do anything** more than we imagine.

Creating an image referencing multiple characters while maintaining consistency. This has not yet been achieved.
Making a 1-minute video. It cannot be done.

When AI cannot do what you want to do, you may think there must be some solution, but in most cases, the progress of AI has not yet reached the point of satisfying your wishes.

Don't rush, let's enjoy the immature AI. Only now can we do that.

## Questions / Correction Reports

An assistant (?) confused by grabbing a ComfyUI node resides in the lower right of the screen 😏 Please hover your mouse over it.

Please feel free to send reports of typos, corrections of content, requests for themes you want explained, etc.
