## How to Open Settings

Settings can be opened from the **ComfyUI Logo** at the top left of the screen -> **⚙ Settings**.

Limited to what is provided, you can configure not only ComfyUI itself but also custom nodes from here.
Basically, you can understand by looking at it, so please try customizing it yourself.

## Personal Recommended Settings

I will introduce some recommended settings.

### Language
`Comfy` -> `Locale` -> `English`
- For Japanese users, this might be set to Japanese, but this site uses `English`.
- I understand the desire to use Japanese, but since most of the terms used are technical terms, translating them poorly into Japanese makes it even more confusing.

### Badge
`Lite Graph` -> `Node` -> `Node source badge mode` -> `Show All`
- Displays a badge indicating whether the node is a ComfyUI core node or a custom node.
- When loading someone else's workflow, you can check which custom node was used.
