In the early days of AI image generation, when Stable Diffusion web UI was mainstream, **ComfyUI** was born with the aim of node-based implementation.

ComfyUI started as a simple image generation tool, but now it is becoming the foundation of the industry as the OS (Operating System) of Generative AI.

## ComfyUI as a Generative AI Engine

ComfyUI provides an environment where you can stably run all kinds of public models, including Stable Diffusion, video generation models like Wan, 3D, and music generation models, on your home PC.

People tend to focus on the node-based UI, but the true value lies in this "engine part".

Even if the visual UI is different, there are countless services and software where ComfyUI is running in the background.

## ComfyUI as a Node-based Tool

For users, the most distinctive feature is probably this node-based UI.

You divide the flow of processing by function, place them as nodes, and connect them.
To master this UI, you need to understand the mechanism of image generation and the role of nodes.
Compared to tools where you "just enter a prompt and press a button", it might feel unfriendly at first.

However, this has a huge advantage.
When a new model or method appears, you can flexibly incorporate it into your existing workflow just by adding the corresponding node.

To keep up with the rapidly advancing AI technology, this flexible node-based UI might be the optimal solution.

## ComfyUI as a Generative AI Platform

What supports the extensibility of ComfyUI is the mechanism called **Custom Nodes**.

ComfyUI itself provides the minimum foundation for running models.
Even for models not supported by the core, developers around the world create "Custom Nodes" so that they can be run immediately.

- **Users**: Can use the latest models with a familiar UI
- **Developers**: Don't have to build a UI from scratch, and can have their technology used

This mutual benefit strongly supports the ComfyUI community.

## Organization and Operation

Originally a personal project by **Comfyanonymous**, it is now organized as [Comfy.org](https://www.comfy.org/about), and development and fundraising are being conducted.

In this field where progress is rapid, it is difficult for an individual to continue maintenance.
By becoming an organization, a stable development structure and continuous updates are now guaranteed.

Whether as an individual or a company, there is no more reassuring reason to choose ComfyUI as a generative AI engine.
