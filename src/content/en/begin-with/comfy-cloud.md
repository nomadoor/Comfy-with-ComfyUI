## What is Comfy Cloud?

**Comfy Cloud** is an official cloud service provided by Comfy Org.
You can instantly use ComfyUI in an environment equipped with high-performance GPUs (such as A100 40GB) just by opening a browser.

It is still in beta and does not have the freedom of the local version (such as adding arbitrary custom nodes), but if you just want to run models, there is no problem and it is a good option.
