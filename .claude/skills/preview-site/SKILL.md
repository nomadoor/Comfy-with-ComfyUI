# Preview The Site Locally

Paths are relative to the repository root.

## Start it

```bash
COMFY_MEDIA_ORIGINALS=/mnt/e/ai/comfy-with-comfyui-media npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` alone works **only** if the shell already exports `COMFY_MEDIA_ORIGINALS`. It is exported from `~/.bashrc`, which is read once per shell, so a terminal opened before that line was added does not have it. Passing it inline always works.

Never start a server without being asked. Check for one first, and never leave one running.

## Diagnose

Who holds the port, and does that process have the originals root?

```bash
P=$(ss -ltnp 2>/dev/null | grep -oP ':8080.*pid=\K[0-9]+' | head -1); echo "pid=${P:-none}"
[ -n "$P" ] && tr '\0' '\n' < /proc/$P/environ | grep -i COMFY_MEDIA_ORIGINALS || echo "NOT SET"
```

List every dev server, including ones left over from an earlier session:

```bash
pgrep -af "eleventy --serve" | grep -v grep || echo "(none running)"
```

Is an unuploaded original actually reachable?

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{content_type} %{size_download}\n" \
  http://localhost:8080/__media-originals/<section>/<slug>/<file>.png
```

## Gotchas

**A stale server squats the port.** Only the first process to bind 8080 serves; later ones still write `_site`. So the HTML can be correct while images 404, because the *serving* process is an older one with no `COMFY_MEDIA_ORIGINALS`. Symptom: `<img src="/__media-originals/...">` is right in the HTML, and the image request returns 404. Kill every `eleventy --serve` and start one.

**`_data/*.js` is cached per process.** Editing `src/_data/nav.*.yml`, a slug, `navId`, or `ops/ia.md` does **not** take effect until the server restarts — the running process keeps the nav it loaded at startup. It can also fail loudly: a renamed page left the old placeholder path in memory and the build died with `ENOENT: ... _site/ja/data-utilities/loops/index.html`. Article text and media are picked up normally; nav and identity changes are not.

**`npm run build` refusing unregistered media is correct.** Production builds throw on a `/media/...` that is not in `src/_data/media.json`; dev servers only warn and render the original instead ([.eleventy.js:489](.eleventy.js:489)). So the build failing while writing an article is expected — it clears once the pre-commit `media:sync` uploads and registers the files. Do not "fix" it by editing `media.json` by hand.

**Video posters do not exist before upload.** In the dev preview a video's poster is empty, because the poster is a frame `media:sync` extracts and uploads. `{media=player}` therefore shows no thumbnail locally; `{media=loop}` plays regardless. Nothing is wrong.

**`_site` keeps deleted pages.** After a rename, the old URL still answers 200 from the stale output directory. `rm -rf _site/<lang>/<section>/<old-slug>` to check a rename honestly.
