# Workflow JSON

## Rules

- Workflow JSON files live under `src/workflows/<section-or-type>/<slug>/`.
- Keep workflow files reproducible enough for a third party to load and understand the documented result.
- Do not edit unrelated workflow JSONs.
- Remove Windows `Zone.Identifier` sidecar files if they appear in the worktree.
- Keep article links and workflow file paths in sync.

## Workflow

1. Identify the owning article slug and section.
2. Place JSON files in the matching workflow folder.
3. Validate changed JSON files before build.
4. Check all article links to the workflow files.
5. If workflow behavior changes the article claim, update the article text too.

## Checks

- `npm run check:workflows`
- `npm run check:content`
- `npm run build`

For a single file during iteration:

```bash
node -e "JSON.parse(require('node:fs').readFileSync(process.argv[1], 'utf8'))" path/to/workflow.json
```
